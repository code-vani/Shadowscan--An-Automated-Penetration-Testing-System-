# Shadowscan - An Automated Penetration Testing System

## 🛡️ Overview

**Shadowscan** is an automated penetration testing system designed to simplify the process of security testing. It helps security professionals and enthusiasts **identify vulnerabilities, perform reconnaissance, and exploit weaknesses** in a structured and automated manner.

This tool is intended for **ethical use only**—testing should be done on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and strictly prohibited.

## ⚙️ Features

* **Automated Reconnaissance**: Gathers information about targets efficiently using `recon.py`.
* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identifies common vulnerabilities with `vuln.py`.
* **Exploitation Module**: Exploits discovered vulnerabilities through `exploit.py`.
* **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new tools and modules.
* **Central Control**: `main.py` orchestrates the entire penetration testing workflow.
